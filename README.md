#Process

1️⃣ Data Collection & Import
Gather online sales data from various sources (e.g., Excel, SQL, e-commerce platforms).

Import data into Power BI using the "Get Data" feature.

2️⃣ Data Cleaning & Processing (Power Query)
Remove duplicates, correct formatting issues, and handle missing values.

Convert data types (e.g., date, currency, categories) for accurate analysis.

Merge or append multiple datasets for a unified data model.

3️⃣ Data Modeling & Transformation (DAX & Power Query)
Create relationships between tables (e.g., Orders, Customers, Products).

Implement DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) to compute key metrics like:

Total Sales = SUM([Revenue])

Average Order Value (AOV) = DIVIDE(SUM([Revenue]), COUNT([Order ID]))

Customer Retention Rate = ([Returning Customers] / [Total Customers]) * 100

4️⃣ Creating Visualizations & Interactive Dashboard
Design key visual elements:

Bar & Line Charts for sales trends.

Pie Charts & Heatmaps for customer segmentation.

KPI Cards for quick insights (Total Sales, AOV, CLV).

Filters & Slicers for dynamic data exploration.

Customize dashboard layout for a clear and engaging user experience.

5️⃣ Insights & Reporting
Identify top-performing products, regions, and customers.

Analyze sales trends over time to detect patterns and growth opportunities.

Evaluate the impact of promotions, discounts, and seasonal changes.

Generate automated reports and dashboards for stakeholders.

6️⃣ Export & Deployment
Save and publish the Power BI dashboard for web or app access.

Enable scheduled data refresh for real-time analytics.

Share insights with business teams via Power BI Service or PDF exports.
